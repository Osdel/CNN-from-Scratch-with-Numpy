# CNN from scratch with numpy
This project is for educational purpose only, don't use it in production. The code is based on the CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition by Andrej Karpathy.
Recommended to understand how convolutional  networks works and look inside each component and build it from scratch with numpy.

## Dependencies
* [numpy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpy)

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Testing the Code
The test case was stracted from Karpathy's example
```bash
python test.py
```
